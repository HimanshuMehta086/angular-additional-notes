# Angular 8: Template-Driven Forms
1.	Template-driven forms take their life in template. In order to use T-D form-specific capabilities, we need to import a built-in `FormsModule` from `@angular/forms`. This module has many form-specific directives.
2.	We start with creating a normal html form. Make use that you remove `action` attribute in this form. Also, apply `novalidate` and `autocomplete="off"` at the form tag. This form needs to be handled by Angular now. In order to do that, we need to export the implicit directive applied to the form. Also, it is a better practice to hook to the default submit event published by the Angular by using `(ngSubmit)="submitHandler()"`. We do this by `<form #f="ngForm"(ngSubmit)="submitHandler()" autocomplete="off" novalidate>...</form>`
3.	We let Angular know about the constituent parts of the form (input elements: such as input, select, checkbox, radio, etc), by applying `ngModel` directive. If we have a model object in the component class and we like to bind data two-ways, we use `[(ngModel)]="model.property"` syntax, though this is not necessary. If we want a one way binding, we can use `[ngModel]="model.property"`. If we do not wish to use any model in the component, we just apply `ngModel`. Do not forget to use `name="xyz"` property for all the input elements, otherwise it will be an error.
4.	If we like to see the value representation of the form, we can use `f.value` and apply `json` pipe as in `<p>{{ f.value | json }}</p>`. `ngForm` when exported as `#f` gives useful properties such as `valid`, `invalid`, etc which could be used to alter the behaviour of the form (such as to disable the submit until the form is invalid by `[disabled]="f.invalid"`)
5.	In order to get the validation status of the field, we need to export the field with its implicit `ngModel` as `#field="ngModel"`. Validation is done by applying built-in Angular directives such as `required`, `maxlength`, `minlength`, `pattern`, etc. This field will now contains all the Angular specific form control fields such as errors.
6.	Every field is initially `prestine` and `untouched`. There is `valid` field, but it depends on the validation directives applied to it. If the user tabs over or has touched the control, Angular marks the state of the control as `touched`. When a value is entered, it will become `dirty`. Based on these properties in conjunction with errors object, we can display custom errors. Please refer to template form in the polling app.
