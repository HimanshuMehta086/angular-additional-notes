# Angular 8: Property Binding
1. As far as the state of the component goes, the first thing that comes handy is declaring the hard-coded values directly in the template. For example, `<h2>Id is: AB1234</h2>`. This is inflexible and defeats the purpose of dynamic nature of the apps.
2. So, we create the field/s in the component class and use the fields in the template using interpolation. For example: `<h2>Id is: {{ id }}</h2>`.
3. Even this approach is not very helpful if the component is being used by another parent component. Such fields make the component hard to reuse.
4. Therefore, in such cases, we would like to **open up** the fields to the outside world so that the parent can supply the data to these fields at the time of usage. In our example, poll-container is the parent and poll-item is the child. So, poll-container will supply essential data for the poll-item (such as imageUrl, title, description, etc) in poll-container template.
5. To accomplish this, we first need to decorate the fields (in the child component) with @Input(), such as `@Input() item: PollItem;`. Now the poll-container can use `<app-poll-item [item]="expression"></app-poll-item>`.
6. Please note that `[item]="expression"` is the input property for poll-item (child component). Square brackets are used because, we are passing an expression, not a hard-coded value. Usually, this expression is a field declared in the parent component or something that a method in the parent TS class returns. Basically, the expression is evaluated.
7. It is a good practice to use as few input properties as possible. If possible, group the input properties with a model class (such as PollItem model class).
