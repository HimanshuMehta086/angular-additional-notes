Angular 8: RxJS
1.	RxJS is the short form for **Reactive Extensions for JavaScript**. The core concept in reactive programming is that of the **Observable**. An observable **encapsulates** an object and creates a stream where the *underlying data comes over time*.
2.	For example, we can make an array (a straightforward object) as an observable using `of` operator from rxjs. Now, in order to get to this array we need to *flatten* (or cut open) the observable. This is done by subscribing (`observable.subscribe(...)`)to the observable.
3.	Conventionally, the fields that are observables, are written with `$` suffix, such as `itemCollection$`
4.	Every observable has the `subscribe` method. We need to pass a callback function (usually a lambda expression). The argument for the callback is the underlying data.
5.	Observables are *cold*. That means unless we subscribe to them, they do not start their work.
6.	If we combine the idea of observables and services in Angular, we have a very solid state-management solution.
7.	In Angular, ideally we avoid subscribing to the observables because the subscription has to be unsubscribed after the view is destroyed. So, at the time of subscription, we get a reference to the *subscription object*, which should be used to `unsubscribe` in the `ngOnDestroy` lifecycle hook (part of `OnDestroy` interface). This is tedious and error-prone. Therefore, as far as possible, we let the template handle automatic subscribe and unsubscribe by using `async` pipe. Please refer to the polling-app project.
