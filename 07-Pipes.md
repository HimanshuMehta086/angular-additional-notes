# Angular 8: Custom Pipes
1. We can create a custom pipe by ng g p xyz
2. A pipe is decorated with `@Pipe({...})`. Pipes implement PipeTransform interface. That means we should implement `[transform(value: any,  ...args: any[]): any]` method, where value is the value to which we apply the pipe, ...args (called the rest operator) is actually an array (args is the name of the array), which contains the optional parameters passed (comma separated but a single string). Whatever this method returns will replace the target. Please refer to angular-view project.
3. Pipes come in two flavours: pure and impure. By default, the pipes are pure. Pure pipes (default) are applied when the object or primitive is changed (assignment), but not when mutated. Impure pipes are marked by setting pure property in @Pipe as false. These are expensive in the sense they are executed for every object mutation. Perhaps this may be the exact behaviour you want. But generally, unless we have a sound use case, it is advised not to use impure pipes.
