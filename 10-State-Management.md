# Angular 8: State Management
1.	As application gets larger and more complex, the state management becomes a sizable issue. This particularly a problem when the unrelated components are to communicate with each other or share a common state.
2.	Fortunately, thanks to Angular dependency injection mechanism, we have the perfect construct to help us: a service. A service in Angular is decorated with @Injectible decorator and providedIn: root property tells the Angular runtime to create a singleton of the service. That means, there is going to be a single instance of the service throughout the application. Therefore, all the interested parties (components) interact with this service. Service allows such data interactions through exposing the a suitable API.
3.	In Angular, we usually combine this idea of service with observables. So we have reactive services. There are cases where the data needs to be updated by the user components. In such cases, the Observable based systems need to be told to update themselves. This is where the concept of BehaviorSubject comes into play. BehaviorSubject is both an observer as well as the observable. Normally, the output users use the asObservable() of BehaviorSubject. When the data is updated, the BehaviourSubject's next method will be called so that the output users are immediately notified of the change. This way, we keep the state in sync. It is also possible to use BehaviorSubjects for all kinds of state management scenarios. A developer must exercise descretion here. Please refer to line 36-46 in `poll.service.ts` in the polling-app.
