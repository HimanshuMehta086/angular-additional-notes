# Angular 8: Http Communication
1.	We use `HttpClientModule` to provide us the functionality to work with http communication. To do this, first **import** `HttpClientModule` in the `app.module.ts`. Make sure that this module is imported from `@angular/common/http package`.
2.	Through this import, the `HttpClient` class is available as injectable service (this is a built-in service). If a component would like to make http communication, we can inject this base service (`HttpClient`) directly in the component's constructor. However, this is not a good practice. We usually abstract the http communication in a service. Therefore, we inject the `HttpClient` in the constructor of the service.
3.	`HttpClient` exposes the observable-based API for all common http verbs (such as `get`, `post`, `delete`, `put`, etc). It's the best practice not to subscribe to these observable in the service. The job of the service should be to return the observable as it is to the consumers. Please also note that the observables are cold. Meaning, they do not get triggered by assignment. One needs to subscribe to them in order to start the process. Please refer to: [https://angular.io/guide/http](https://angular.io/guide/http). Please see how the the generic methods can be used to our advantage such as return `this.http.get<PollItem>('http://localhost:3000/api/get');`. This returns a type-safe return `Observable<PollItem>`.
