# Angular 8: Components
1. Component is a piece in the UI (or view) that has structure, style, state, and behaviour of its own. Every component is a TS class decorated with @Component. Every component's metadata contains a selector (used as an HTML tag such as `<app-xyz>`), template file (x.component.html), a styles array (x.component.css), and a test file (x.component.spec.ts). A component is generated (or created) by `ng g c my-component`. Conventionally, the component's name is separted by dahses such as: poll-item
2. A component in its template, can use other components just as it uses standard HTML tags. For example, poll-container component's template can use poll-item component. This way, poll-container is called the parent component and poll-item is known as the child component. If we put things in perspective, the whole Angular app is a tree like structure of component hierarchy. Of course at the root we have root component (AppComponent).
3. There can of course exist components that are not parent or child of each other. For example, nav and poll-container are independent components. But these are somehow connected by common parent (either direct or up the hierarchy). In this case, nav and poll-container have a common parent (AppComponent).
4. A component's class file or TS file can declare fields and methods. These are immediately usable by the template (HTML file) associated with the component. This is done by **string interpolation** or **value binding** using `{{ field }}`. This is a one-way binding (from class to template or from component to DOM).
5. The output of string interpolation can be controlled by applying a pipe. A pipe is basically a function which transforms the output based on some logic customizable by options. There are built-in pipes for general use. Please see this use case: `{{ today | date:"dd/MM/yyyy" }}`. You may wish to refer [https://angular.io/api?type=pipe](https://angular.io/api?type=pipe)
